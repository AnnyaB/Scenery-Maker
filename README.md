## Optional Task: Scenery Building with Java OOP (Using BlueJ)

In this optional exercise, you’ll create a simple graphical scenery in Java that includes a truck, a tree, and the sun.

This task is ideal for those working in BlueJ (version 5.2.1), although IntelliJ can be used as well. However, BlueJ offers unique features for graphical object-oriented programming (OOP) that make it especially suitable for visualizing the relationships between objects, classes, methods, and fields. Working in BlueJ feels like constructing a game, allowing you to see how client and supplier classes interact in real-time.

## Getting Started

You’ll primarily work within the Picture class, which you can modify to enhance the scenery.
Feel free to experiment! Add more objects to the scenery if you'd like. If you want to incorporate more complex shapes (like parallelograms), create a new class named Parallelogram.
Although you can access the Canvas class to better understand how objects are drawn, avoid changing its code unless you're adding new classes or colors.

## Running Your Program

For greater flexibility, individual Java files have been provided. You can run the entire code and view the output without BlueJ.
Enjoy the Task!
This exercise is designed to make learning OOP concepts enjoyable and interactive, so have fun experimenting with building and modifying your scenery!
