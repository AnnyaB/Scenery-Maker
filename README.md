## Optional Task  

- Inside this scenery there is a truck, a tree and sun
- Optional task project from course work 
- We are programming in java using bluej, you can install the version 5.2.1 as well or continue with IntelliJ
- Bluej is effiecient for graphical OOP   
- You can visualise OOP Objects, Classes, Methods and fields. Hence, learn better 
- Feels like a game when you engage yourself with constructing client and supplier classes
- You can change the picture class as you wish and add more stuffs inside the scenery
- However, if you want to add more real objects like parallelograms etc.. then you need to add a new class called "Parallelogram". (Which I think you wouldn't require for now)
- Update the picture class as required, if you are trying to look into the canvas class(which I suppose you might want to, but you don't actually need to) All the best although, make 
  sure to not touch the code inside the Canvas class unless you are adding new Classes or colors
- For runtime flexibility, I have added seperate java files as well. You would be able to access the whole code and see the output wihtout using bluej
- Have fun :)
