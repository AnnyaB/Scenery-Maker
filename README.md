## From weekly module tasks  

- Optional task project from Java programming module 
- We are programming in java using bluej, you can install the version 5.2.1 as well
- Bluej is effiecient for graphical OOP   
- You visualise OOP Objects, Classes, Methods and fields, learn better 
- Feels like a game when you engage yourself with constructing client and supplier classes. You can change the picture class as you wish and add more stuffs inside the scenery.
  However, if you want to add more real objects like parallelograms etc.. then you need to add a new class called "Parallelogram". 
- Update the picture class as required, if you are trying to look into the canvas class(which I suppose you might want to, but you don't actually need to) All the best although, make 
  sure to not touch the code inside the Canvas class.
